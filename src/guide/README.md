# Getting Started

**TwilioQuest Extensions** are available in the upcoming 3.2 release of TwilioQuest, which we plan on launching in October at [SIGNAL 2021](https://signal.twilio.com). Before then, you may need to select the "3.2 Preview" branch in the launcher after [downloading and installing the game](https://www.twilio.com/quest/download).
